# Project Title

Jazz Guitar Chord Voicings

## How To Build

A pre-built .pdf version is committed as 'guitarchords.pdf'.

Alternatively, you may open guitarchords.tex and build it with LuaLaTeX.

## Contributing

I welcome pull requests with interesting/useful voicings and a description of
*why* they are interesting/useful.  Please note that I don't want this to be a
catch-all with a million guitar voicings -- there are enough of those -- but if
you have something that fits in with the theme of the document, that's cool.
